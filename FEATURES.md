# Deserialization

- **docx**: Almost complete. numbering::PictureBase can hold any elements from specific namespaces and it's not implemented yet
- **pptx**: Complete
- **shared**: Almost complete. drawingml::GraphicalObjectData's aren't parsed yet.

All other office file formats are unsupported right now.

# Serialization

Currently there are no way to build any of the office file formats and serialize them. This feature is planned but not
a high priority.
